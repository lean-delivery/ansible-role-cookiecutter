# Ansible Style Guide
{: .no_toc }

This document defines code guidelines for Ansible roles included in lean-delivery project. These guidelines are provided for Ansible role authors and contributors to ensure that the code of Ansible roles included in the project is following the agreed conventions. Following these conventions makes code better in terms of readability and simplifies further support and development.

## Practices

You should follow the [Best Practices](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_best_practices.html) defined by the Ansible documentation when developing playbooks.

### Why?
{: .no_toc }

The Ansible developers have a good understanding of how the playbooks work and where they look for certain files. Following these practices will avoid a lot of problems.

### Why Doesn't Your Style Follow Theirs?

The script examples are inconsistent in style throughout the Ansible documentation; the purpose of this document is to define a consistent style that can be used throughout Ansible scripts to create robust, readable code.

---

## Start of Files

All YAML files (regardless of their association with Ansible or not) should begin with `---` to define the document start. 

### Why?
{: .no_toc }

It's better processed by linters and parsers. It allows easily indicate start of new yaml objects and documents.

---

## End of Files

You should always end your files with a newline.

### Why?
{: .no_toc }

This is common Unix best practice, and avoids any prompt misalignment when printing files in a terminal.

---

## Quotes

**You should only quote strings when it is absolutely necessary** or required by YAML, and then use single quotes. 
Single quotes are preferrable to double since they are shorter and require less efforts to support, especially for roles supporting Windows.

### Double quotes should be used in the following cases:
{: .no_toc }

1.  When they are nested within single quotes (e.g. Jinja map reference)

    ```yaml {% raw %}
    - name: start all services
      service:
        name: '{{ item["service_name"] }}'
        state: started
        enabled: true
      loop: '{{ services }}' {% endraw %}
    ```

2.  When your string requires escaping characters (e.g. using "\n" to represent a newline)

    ```yaml
    # double quotes to escape characters
    - name print text with two lines
      debug:
        msg: "Line one\nLine two"
    ```

3.  When you need to split long string without spaces to several lines:

    ```yaml
    # long string without spaces
    - name Set plugin url 
      set_fact:
        plugin_jar: "https://github.com/checkstyle/\
                      sonar-checkstyle/releases/download/4.17/\
                      checkstyle-sonar-plugin-4.17.jar"
    ```

### Why?
{: .no_toc }

Even though strings are the default type for YAML, syntax highlighting looks better when explicitly set types. This also helps troubleshoot malformed strings when they should be properly escaped to have the desired effect.

## Long strings

If you write a long string containing whitespaces, it's preferrable to use the "Literal Block Scalar" style and omit all special quoting. Values can span multiple lines using `|` or `>`. Spanning multiple lines using a "Literal Block Scalar" (`|`) will include the newlines and any trailing spaces. Using a "Folded Block Scalar" (`>`) will fold newlines to spaces; itâ€™s used to make what would otherwise be a very long line easier to read and edit:

```yaml {% raw %}
java_folder: >-
  {{ (java_major_version|int <= 8)
    | ternary(java_package + '1.' + java_major_version|string + '.0_' + java_minor_version|string,
              java_package + '-'  + java_major_version|string + '.'   + java_minor_version|string) }} {% endraw %}
```

If you need to preserve line breaks use the following approach:

```yaml {% raw %}
- name: Warn on unsupported platform
  fail:
    msg: |
      This role does not support '{{ ansible_os_family }}' platform.
        Please contact support@lean-delivery.com {% endraw %}
```

## Booleans

Ansible supports many different ways to specify a boolean value: `True/False`, `true/false`, `yes/no`, `1/0`. We prefer to avoid mixing of various styles and stick to one : `true/false`.

```yaml
# bad
- name: start nginx
  service:
    name: nginx
    state: started
    enabled: yes
  become: yes
 
# good
- name: start nginx
  service:
    name: nginx
    state: started
    enabled: true
  become: true
```

### Why?
The main reasoning behind this is that Python have same convention for boolean values. 

---

## Colon spacing

Use only one space after the colon when designating a key value pair

```yaml
# bad
- name : start nginx
  service:
    name    : nginx
    state   : started
    enabled : true
  become : true


# good
- name: start nginx
  service:
    name: nginx
    state: started
    enabled: true
  become: true
```

### Why?

It's easier to edit avoiding extra aligning efforts for colons.

---

## Key-Value pairs

Ansible allows two types of YAML syntax:
* legacy key=value style
* structured map style

**Always use the map syntax,** regardless of how many pairs exist in the map.

```yaml
# bad
- name: Create configuration file with parameters
  file: path=/etc/sensu/conf.d/checks state=directory mode=0755 owner=sensu group=sensu
  become: true
  
- name: Copy configuration file
  copy: dest=/etc/sensu/conf.d/checks/ src=checks/check-memory.json
  become: true
  
# good
- name: Create configuration file with parameters
  file:
    path: /etc/sensu/conf.d/checks
    state: directory
    group: sensu
    mode: 0755
    owner: sensu
  become: true
  
- name: Copy configuration file
  copy:
    dest: /etc/sensu/conf.d/checks/
    src: checks/check-memory.json
  become: true
```

### Why?
{: .no_toc }

The legacy key=value syntax is used on the command line for adhoc commands. The use of this style within playbooks and roles is a bad practice making playbooks harder to read and support. 

Structured map style makes code more compact in terms of line length and that makes code more easy to read. Each module parameter is places on its own line making possible to comment parameters independently. YAML syntax highlighting works better for this format allowing key/value detection, constants highlighting etc.

---

## Variable Names

Use `snake_case` for variable names:

```yaml
# bad
- name: set some facts
  set_fact:
    myBoolean: true
    myint: 20
    MY_STRING: test

# good
- name: set some facts
  set_fact:
    my_boolean: true
    my_int: 20
    my_string: test
```

### Why?
{: .no_toc }

Ansible uses `snake_case` for module names and parameters so it makes sense to extend this convention to variable names to unify style.
